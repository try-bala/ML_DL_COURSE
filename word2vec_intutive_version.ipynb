    "# Why do we need Word Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many Machine Learning algorithms and almost all Deep Learning Architectures are incapable of processing strings or plain text in their raw form. They require numbers as inputs to perform any sort of job, be it classification, regression etc. in broad terms. And with the huge amount of data that is present in the text format, it is imperative to extract knowledge out of it and build applications. Some real world applications of text applications are – sentiment analysis of reviews by Amazon etc., document or news classification or clustering by Google etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Image and audio processing systems work with rich, high-dimensional datasets encoded as vectors of the individual raw pixel-intensities for image data, or e.g. power spectral density coefficients for audio data. For tasks like object or speech recognition we know that all the information required to successfully perform the task is encoded in the data (because humans can perform these tasks from the raw data). However, natural language processing systems traditionally treat words as discrete atomic symbols, and therefore 'cat' may be represented as Id537 and 'dog' as Id143. These encodings are arbitrary, and provide no useful information to the system regarding the relationships that may exist between the individual symbols. This means that the model can leverage very little of what it has learned about 'cats' when it is processing data about 'dogs' (such that they are both animals, four-legged, pets, etc.). Representing words as unique, discrete ids furthermore leads to data sparsity, and usually means that we may need more data in order to successfully train statistical models. Using vector representations can overcome some of these obstacles\n",

    "# What are Word Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "In very simplistic terms, Word Embeddings are the texts converted into numbers and there may be different numerical representations of the same text. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Word Embedding format generally tries to map a word using a dictionary to a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "A word in this sentence may be “Embeddings” or “numbers ” etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary may be the list of all unique words in the sentence. So, a dictionary may look like – [‘Word’,’Embeddings’,’are’,’Converted’,’into’,’numbers’]\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector representation of a word may be a one-hot encoded vector where 1 stands for the position where the word exists and 0 everywhere else. \n",
    "\n",
    "The vector representation of “numbers” in this format according to the above dictionary is [0,0,0,0,0,1] and of converted is[0,0,0,1,0,0].\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us look at different types of Word Embeddings or Word Vectors and their advantages and disadvantages over the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different types of Word Embeddings\n",
    "The different types of word embeddings can be broadly classified into two categories-\n",
    "\n",
    "* Frequency based Embedding\n",
    "* Prediction based Embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "Count-based methods compute the statistics of how often some word co-occurs with its neighbor words in a large text corpus, and then map these count-statistics down to a small, dense vector for each word. Predictive models directly try to predict a word from its neighbors in terms of learned small, dense embedding vectors (considered parameters of the model)."

    "\n",

    "* TF-IDF Vector\n",
    "* Co-Occurrence Vector\n",

    "D1: He is a lazy boy. She is also lazy.\n",
    "\n",
    "D2: Neeraj is a lazy person.\n",

    "#### TF-IDF vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the frequency method but it is different to the count vectorization in the sense that it takes into account not just the occurrence of a word in a single document but in the entire corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common words like ‘is’, ‘the’, ‘a’ etc. tend to appear quite frequently in comparison to the words which are important to a document. For example, a document A on Lionel Messi is going to contain more occurences of the word “Messi” in comparison to other documents. But common words like “the” etc. are also going to be present in higher frequency in almost every document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, what we would want is to down weight the common words occurring in almost all documents and give more importance to words that appear in a subset of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF works by penalising these common words by assigning them lower weights while giving importance to words like Messi in a particular document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the below sample table which gives the count of terms(tokens/words) in two documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='assets/Tf-IDF.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "TF = (Number of times term t appears in a document)/(Number of terms in the document)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, TF(This,Document1) = 1/8\n",
    "\n",
    "TF(This, Document2)=1/5\n",
    "\n",
    "It denotes the contribution of the word to the document i.e words relevant to the document should be frequent. eg: A document about Messi should contain the word ‘Messi’ in large number.\n",
    "\n",
    "IDF = log(N/n), where, N is the number of documents and n is the number of documents a term t has appeared in.\n",
    "\n",
    "where N is the number of documents and n is the number of documents a term t has appeared in.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, IDF(This) = log(2/2) = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do we explain the reasoning behind IDF? Ideally, if a word has appeared in all the document, then probably that word is not relevant to a particular document. But if it has appeared in a subset of documents then probably the word is of some relevance to the documents it is present in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us compute IDF for the word ‘Messi’.\n",
    "\n",
    "IDF(Messi) = log(2/1) = 0.301.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let us compare the TF-IDF for a common word ‘This’ and a word ‘Messi’ which seems to be of relevance to Document 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF(This,Document1) = (1/8) * (0) = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF(This, Document2) = (1/5) * (0) = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF(Messi, Document1) = (4/8)*0.301 = 0.15\n",
    "\n",
    "As, you can see for Document1 , TF-IDF method heavily penalises the word ‘This’ but assigns greater weight to ‘Messi’. So, this may be understood as ‘Messi’ is an important word for Document1 from the context of the entire corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Co-Occurrence Matrix with a fixed context window\n",
    "\n",
    "The big idea – Similar words tend to occur together and will have similar context for example – Apple is a fruit. Mango is a fruit.\n",
    "Apple and mango tend to have a similar context i.e fruit.\n",
    "\n",
    "co-occurrence – For a given corpus, the co-occurrence of a pair of words say w1 and w2 is the number of times they have appeared together in a Context Window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Context Window – Context window is specified by a number and the direction. So what does a context window of 2 (around) means? Let us see an example below : \n",
    "\n",

    "Corpus = \"He is not lazy. He is intelligent. He is smart.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "So far, we have seen deterministic methods to determine word vectors. But these methods proved to be limited in their word representations until Mitolov etc. el introduced ***word2vec*** to the NLP community. These methods were prediction based in the sense that they provided probabilities to the words and proved to be state of the art for tasks like word analogies and word similarities. \n",

    "## How word2vec works:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind word2vec is that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Take a 3 layer neural network. (1 input layer + 1 hidden layer + 1 output layer)\n",
    "* Feed it a word and train it to predict its neighbouring word.\n",
    "* Remove the last (output layer) and keep the input and hidden layer.\n",
    "* Now, input a word from within the vocabulary. The output given at the hidden layer is the ‘word embedding’ of the input word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to popular belief, word2vec is not a deep network, it only has 3 layers!\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2vec is a particularly computationally-efficient predictive model for learning word embeddings from raw text. It comes in two flavors, the Continuous Bag-of-Words model (CBOW) and the Skip-Gram model (Section 3.1 and 3.2 in Mikolov et al.). Algorithmically, these models are similar, except that CBOW predicts target words (e.g. 'mat') from source context words ('the cat sits on the'), while the skip-gram does the inverse and predicts source context-words from the target words. \n",
    "\n",
    " This inversion might seem like an arbitrary choice, but statistically it has the effect that CBOW smoothes over a lot of the distributional information (by treating an entire context as one observation). For the most part, this turns out to be a useful thing for smaller datasets. However, skip-gram treats each context-target pair as a new observation, and this tends to do better when we have larger datasets. We will focus on the skip-gram model in the rest of this tutorial."
